      <br><i>Pumpkins!</i><br><br>
      Pumpkin, pumpkin, everything pumpkin. But what about chocolate, too? If you like chocolate chips in your pumpkin bread, then this recipe is for you! If you don’t, you’ll appreciate the addition of cloves and cardamom for warmth and the use of extra-virgin olive oil for a fruity, savory kick. Either way, this crowd-pleasing chocolate pumpkin sheet cake–which is just a term for a larger, highly sharable cake–will not disappoint.
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>1 3/4 cups (210 g) <b>all-purpose flour</b></li>
      <li>3/4 cups (65 g) <b>unsweetened cocoa powder</b></li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons <b>baking soda</b></li>
      <li>½ teaspoon <b>baking powder</b></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon <b>kosher salt</b></li>
      <li>Pinch of <b>ground cloves</b> (optional)</li>
      <li>Pinch of <b>ground cardamom</b> (optional)</li>
      <li>1 15 oz (425 g) can of <b>pumpkin pureé</b> (be sure to use pumpkin pureé, not pumpkin pie filling)</li>
      <li>½ cup (100 g) <b>extra-virgin olive oil</b></li> (or neutral-flavored oil, such as canola or vegetable oil)
      <li>1 cup (200 g)
<b>granulated sugar</b></li>
      <li>¼ cup (50 g)
<b>brown sugar</b></li>
      <li>1 tablespoon <b>apple cider vinegar</b> (or white vinegar)
      <li>1 teaspoon <b>vanilla extract</b></li>
      <li>1 cup (240 g) <b>black coffee</b>, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (120 g) <b>water</b>, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 cup (170 g) <b>chocolate chips</b> (optional)</li>
      <li><b>Optional frosting</b>: 1 15-ounce (425 g) can pumpkin pureé (pumpkin pureé, not pumpkin pie filling); 1 ¾ cups (300 g) chocolate chips; 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; ½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350o Fahrenheit and line a 9x13 inch baking pan with parchment paper.
      In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, unsweetened cocoa powder, kosher salt, baking soda, baking powder, cloves (if using), and cardamom (if using) until well-combined.
      Over a countertop, remove the pumpkin pureé from its can and onto a clean kitchen towel or a sheet of paper towels. Blot the pumpkin pureé with the towel(s) to remove excess moisture. Pumpkin is a very wet ingredient–lots of moisture should be blotted out in order for the cake to turn out well.
      Add the blotted pumpkin pureé to a large mixing bowl along with the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, vinegar, and vanilla extract and whisk until combined. Add the black coffee and water to the pumpkin mixture and stir until well-combined.      Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and mix using a rubber spatula until the batter is just combined. If using chocolate chips, add to the batter and fold until evenly distributed throughout.
      Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 50-60 minutes or until the cake is done and bounces back when pressed lightly.
      For the optional frosting, heat the pumpkin pureé in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring consistently. Once the pumpkin pureé is hot, remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate chips, stirring vigorously until melted and well-incorporated into the pumpkin pureé. Stir in the vanilla extract and chocolate chips. Let cool to room temperature before using.
      Once done, let cool in the pan on a wire cooling rack for at least 1 hour. If using frosting, frost the cake once it is fully cooled and no longer warm to the touch. Enjoy!
