      Fall calls for a cozy snack cake just like this one. With plenty of brown sugar crumble, caramel-y dates, and warm spices, this banana crumb cake is just as easy to make as it is to devour. Someone made my day in House by saying, “I think this may have been your best.”      </div>

              <li>1/2 cup (100 g) <b>neutral oil</b> (such as canola or vegetable)</li>
              <li>1/2 cup (100 g) <b>brown sugar</b></li>
              <li>1/4 cup (50 g) <b>granulated sugar</b></li>
              <li>1 1/2 teaspoon <b>vanilla extract</b></li>
              <li>3/4 teaspoon <b>sea salt</b></li>
              <li>1 teaspoon <b>baking powder</b></li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon <b>baking soda</b></li>
              <li>1 teaspoon <b>pumpkin pie spice</b> (or cinnamon)</li>
              <li>1 3/4 cups (210 g) <b>white whole-wheat flour</b></li>
            </ol></li>
          <li>½ cup (80 g) <b>pitted dates</b>, roughly chopped (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and line an 8x8 inch baking pan with parchment paper. Make the crumb topping. In a small bowl, mix together the ½ cup (60 g) all-purpose flour, the ¼ cup (25 g) rolled oats, and the ¼ cup (50 g) brown sugar using a fork. Add the ¼ cup (50 g) neutral flavored oil and the ½ teaspoon vanilla extract. Mix again with the fork until combined. Make the cake batter. To a large mixing bowl, add the mashed bananas, the ½ cup (100 g) neutral flavored oil, the  ½ cup (100 g) brown sugar, granulated sugar, pure vanilla extract, sea salt, pumpkin pie spice (or cinnamon), and freshly ground black pepper. Whisk together until well-combined. Add the baking powder and the baking soda and stir to combine. Fold in the all-purpose flour using a rubber spatula. Pour the cake batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle the chopped dates on top (if using) and then sprinkle on the crumb topping. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the middle of the cake and the cake bounces back when lightly pressed in the center. Set the pan atop a wire cooling rack and let cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes. Enjoy!
      Once done, let cool in the pan on a wire cooling rack for at least 1 hour. If using frosting, frost the cake once it is fully cooled and no longer warm to the touch. Enjoy!
