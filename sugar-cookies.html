    <h2>Fluffy Sugar Cookies</h2>

      Making these fluffy sugar cookies is my idea of the perfect way to spend a snowy day and stay cozy in the winter during the holiday season. A splash of lemon juice helps complete the cookie dough, but the zest is left optional, yet highly recommended as a way to highlight bright, fresh winter citrus. I used lemon zest, but lime, orange, or grapefruit would be welcome variations.
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>¼ cup (60 grams) <b>unsweetened applesauce</b></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon <b>freshly squeezed lemon juice</b></li>
      <li><b>Zest</b> from 1 lemon (optional)</li>
      <li>½ cup (100 grams) <b>granulated sugar</b></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon <b>pure vanilla extract</b></li>
      <li>½ teaspoon <b>sea salt</b></li>
      <li>¼ cup (50 grams) <b>neutral-flavored oil</b>, such as canola oil or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Pinch <b>nutmeg</b> (optional)</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon <b>baking soda</b></li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon <b>baking powder</b></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon <b>cornstarch</b></li>
      <li>1 ½ cups (180 grams) <b>all-purpose flour</b></li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the unsweetened applesauce, freshly squeezed lemon juice, and lemon zest (if using). Let sit for 5 minutes. Add the granulated sugar, pure vanilla extract, sea salt, and nutmeg (if using) to the applesauce mixture and stir well–for roughly 1 minute–to combine. Add the neutral-flavored oil and stir again to fully combine the mixture. Add the baking soda, baking powder, and cornstarch to the applesauce mixture and mix well to combine. Add the all-purpose flour to the applesauce mixture and use a rubber spatula to fold the mixture just until a dough forms. Scoop heaping tablespoons of rough onto the lined cookie sheet, rounding the balls of dough. There should be enough dough for about 10 cookies. Bake the cookies until done and their bottoms are lightly golden-brown, about 10-12 minutes. Set the cookie sheet atop a wire cooling rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Enjoy!    </p>
