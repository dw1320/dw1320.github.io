    It is not fall, so I am quite unsure why I am publishing this recipe now.
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>1 15 oz (425 g) can of <b>pumpkin pureé</b> (be sure to use pumpkin pureé, not pumpkin pie filling)</li>
      <li>½ cup (100 g) <b>extra-virgin olive oil</b></li>
      <li>½ cup (100 g)
<b>brown sugar</b></li>
      <li>¼ cup (75 g)
<b>maple syrup</b></li>
      <li>2 ½ teaspoons <b>pumpkin pie spice</b></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon <b>vanilla extract</b></li>
      <li>½ teaspoon <b>sea salt</b></li>
      <li>2 cups (250 g) <b>whole-wheat flour</b></li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons <b>baking powder</b></li>
      <li>½ teaspoon <b>baking soda</b></li>
      <li>¾ cup (180 g) <b>water</b></li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 400o. Line a baking sheet well with parchment paper. In a medium-large mixing bowl, whisk together the pumpkin pureé, extra-virgin olive oil, brown sugar, maple syrup, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and sea salt until well combined. Pour onto the baking sheet and spread into an even layer, about ½ inch thick and reserve the pumpkin mixing bowl for later use. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are caramelized but not burnt. In the meantime, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and baking soda until well combined and line a 9 by 5 loaf pan with parchment paper. Once the pumpkin mixture is done roasting, remove it from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 350o. Transfer the pumpkin mixture back to its original bowl, add the water, and whisk until combined. Add the flour mixture and mix together until well combined, being careful not to overmix. The batter will be quite thick. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spread the top to even it out, and bake for 30-40 minutes or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Once done baking, remove the pan from the oven, set on a cooling rack, and let cool for an hour. Enjoy!</p>
