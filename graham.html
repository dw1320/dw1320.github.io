      In my opinion, these crackers are the perfect way to welcome the new school year in. They start with a cozy mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cardamom added to the whole-wheat flour and brown sugar base typical of graham crackers. After adding oil, vanilla extract, salt, and water, these crackers are ready to be shaped and pricked with a fork. Then, the large sheet of dough is sliced in order to easily separate the individual crackers once they are baked and ready.

      After a bake in the oven and brief cooling time, these treats are ready to be devoured! For an ultimate bonfire treat, try using these to make smores. Or, enjoy with milk, nut butter, or dipped in chocolate–the possibilities are endless.

      While these delicious graham crackers are a summer classic, the warm spice mixture adds a unique kick and that special fall feeling that these spices bring. Combining aspects of summer and fall, these graham crackers are an amazing way to usher in the upcoming school year. Happy back-to-school!

      Makes 16 graham crackers.
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>2 cups (240 g) whole-wheat flour</li><li>½ cup (100 g) brown sugar</li><li>¾ teaspoons kosher salt</li><li>1 ½ teaspoons cinnamon</li><li>¼ teaspoon nutmeg, optional</li><li>¼ teaspoon cardamom, optional</li><li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger, optional</li><li>¼ cup (50 g) vegetable oil</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>3-6 tablespoons water, as needed
    </ol>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. In a large bowl, thoroughly whisk together the whole-wheat flour, brown sugar, kosher salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and ground ginger. Make a small well in the center of the mixture. To the well in the dry ingredients, add the vegetable oil and vanilla extract. Mix until the vegetable oil and vanilla extract are distributed evenly throughout the dough. The dough will be very crumbly at this point. Then, add the water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing after each addition of water. Once the dough is soft enough to hold together in a ball, stop adding water. (I used 5 tablespoons of water.) Make sure not to add too much water. Shape the dough into a ball and let it rest for ten minutes. In the meantime, cut two rectangles of parchment paper large enough to fit on a baking sheet. Once the dough is done resting, place it onto one of the rectangles of parchment paper. Place the other rectangle of parchment paper on top and use a rolling pin to roll until about 1/8-1/4 inch thick. Prick the rolled dough with a fork. Then, cut into sixteen even rectangles. (These crackers are homemade, so there is no need to be incredibly precise.) Bake for 15 minutes. Let cool on a cooling rack for 10 minutes. Break the large rectangle into the smaller crackers, return the crackers to the baking sheet, and bake for another 5-10 minutes, or until all the cookies are golden-brown and crispy. Let cool on a cooling rack for another 10 minutes. Enjoy!</p>
