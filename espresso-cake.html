    <h2>Espresso Cake</h2>

    <article class="recipe-full">
      When I go to a coffee shop, I often shock friends with my order: a decaf coffee without sugar or milk. Although unconventional, I enjoy this order because the coffee’s deep flavor shines and I can assure myself of a good night’s sleep to come.
    Nonetheless, what does one do when they want to experience coffee’s flavor in a sweet form? Clearly, one creates a comforting cinnamon-espresso cake that tastes as though melted coffee ice cream has been reincarnated in cake form and gifted a crackly cinnamon-sugar topping.
    I insist that you enjoy this cinnamon-espresso cake warm–I am sure that it will take little convincing once the warm, rich aromas of espresso and spice begin to fill your home.
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <!-- Ingredients:
Cake batter:
¾ cup (180 grams) coconut milk (oat milk or dairy milk should work, too)

1 ¾ cups (210 grams) all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon sea salt
¼ cup (60 grams) cold brew coffee

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
½ cup (100 grams) granulated sugar

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
Preheat oven to 350 Fahrenheit and grease and line a 9 inch round cake pan with parchment paper. Whisk the milk and vinegar together in a large bowl. Let rest for about five minutes. In the meantime, prepare the cinnamon sugar by whisking together the granulated sugar, espresso powder, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside. To a medium bowl, add the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt. Whisk to combine. Add the cold brew coffee, espresso powder, vanilla extract, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and oil to the milk mixture and whisk well to combine. Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and fold together using a rubber spatula until just combined–take care not to overmix the batter. Pour half of the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a rubber spatula. Sprinkle roughly half of the cinnamon sugar on top. Pour the remaining batter on top. Smooth again with a rubber spatula and top with the remaining cinnamon sugar. Bake for 40-50 minutes or until done. When it is ready, the cake should spring back when lightly touched. Let cool in the pan atop a wire cooling rack. Do not attempt to remove from pan until 1 hour has passed. Enjoy!<!--    <ol>
